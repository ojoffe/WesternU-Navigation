See the following tips for guidance on using our software:

  All POI's are displayed as colour-coded Jbuttons on the corresponding map. Simply click the button to access the POI's metadada.
  Additionally, upon clicking on a POI, you will then have the option to favourite it.
  
  In developer mode, you can add, remove, and edit the built-in POI's. Keep in mind that changes save automatically and must
  manually be un-done. Adding a POI in developer mode can be done in the same way as adding a User Defined POI to the map. 
  Removing and editing a POI can be done by clicking on an exisiting POI. 
    
  In regards to filtering a map by the different layers, select the layer(s) you wish to be displayed and then click the submit
  button to update the map to show only the desired layer(s).

  A similar story holds for changing floors within a building. On a floor map screen, select the floor you would like to switch
  to from the dropdown menu and then click "go" to switch to the desired floor map screen.

  When searching for a POI, upon a successful match, the POI's metadata will be displayed on screen. Once you close that window,
  the POI will be highlighted on the map for 10 seconds. Ensure that you scroll the whole map to find the POI while it is still
  highlighted.
